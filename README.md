# Angular Chatting System (MEAN Stack)

This is a full-stack real-time chatting application developed using the **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js). The application allows users to communicate in real-time through private messaging and group chats, making it suitable for both personal and professional communication.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly without reloading the page.
- **Group Chat**: Create and participate in group chats.
- **Private Chat**: One-to-one messaging between users.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Socket.io Integration**: Real-time communication is handled using WebSockets.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, providing a great user experience across all devices.
- **MEAN Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular 13
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **WebSocket**: Socket.io for real-time communication
- **Authentication**: JWT for user authentication
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap for responsive design

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher
- **Angular CLI**: Version 13.x or higher
